"""
src/opensak/importer/gsak_importer.py — GSAK direct database importer (issue #469).

Reads a GSAK ``sqlite.db3`` file directly (confirmed genuine SQLite 3,
``PRAGMA user_version = 27`` on two independent real-world installations —
see #469 investigation) and upserts caches straight into OpenSAK's own
SQLAlchemy models, without going via GPX.

── Session 1 (core cache data) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
    - Caches + CacheMemo   -> Cache (scalar fields, incl. the #469 schema
      additions: gc_note, url, elevation, color, guid, watch, gc_cache_id)
    - Corrected            -> UserNote.corrected_lat/lon/is_corrected
    - Waypoints + WayMemo  -> Waypoint (incl. wp_code, url, wp_date,
      created_by_user, wp_flag)
    - Attributes           -> Attribute (names resolved via OpenSAK's own
      Groundspeak attribute table + English strings, since GSAK's Attributes
      table only stores aId/aInc, unlike GPX's inline <gs:attribute> text)

── Session 2 (this addition) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
    - Logs + LogMemo -> Log (full history, not capped like GPX/PQ exports).
      ``log_id`` is built as ``f"{lParent}_{lLogId}"`` rather than using
      GSAK's ``lLogId`` alone: verified against a real 1.1M-row database that
      the same ``lLogId`` can appear on up to 45 *different* caches (e.g. a
      single day's "Team Position Police" power-trail run) — GSAK's log ID
      is not globally unique the way a real GC.com log GUID is, but
      ``(lParent, lLogId)`` together always is (verified 1,123,992 rows =
      1,123,992 distinct pairs). ``lEncoded`` maps straight to
      ``text_encoded`` (same concept as GPX's ``<gs:text encoded="..">``).
      ``lIsowner`` -> ``logged_by_owner`` (#469 schema addition).
      ``log_count``/``last_log_date`` on Cache are (re)computed from the
      imported logs, mirroring GPX import (#87/#186).

── Session 3 (this addition, issue #472) ─────────────────────────────────────
    - CacheMemo.UserNote -> UserNote.note (personal note text). Embedded
      local ``file:///`` image references (from GSAK's own "GrabImages"
      macro) are replaced with ``[image: filename.ext]`` placeholders —
      verified against a real 12,600-cache database: 154 notes / 312 <img>
      tags, all matching one consistent pattern. ``scan_gsak_notes_for_
      embedded_images()`` lets the (future, session 4) import dialog show a
      one-time count before the user commits to importing.
      UserNote is now created/updated whenever there is corrected coords
      OR note text (previously only on corrected coords — a real GSAK
      database showed 2,348 of 2,446 notes have text but no corrected
      coords, so the narrower condition silently dropped almost all real
      note text). Like Waypoints/Attributes/Logs, the note is unconditionally
      overwritten on every import — no "protect existing note" merge logic,
      per Allan's call that this is mostly a one-time GSAK-to-OpenSAK
      migration rather than a repeated two-way sync.

── Session 4 (this addition, issue #538) ─────────────────────────────────────
    - CacheMemo.TravelBugs -> Trackable (name, ref, tracking_code). GSAK
      stores one line per trackable in a single text field, format
      ``<Name> (id = <TrackableID>, ref = <Trackable Reference>)`` (one
      trackable per line — confirmed by #538 reporter's example:
      ``Best TB ever (id = 1234567, ref = TBAB12CD)``). Parsed with
      ``_parse_gsak_trackables()``; a line that doesn't match the pattern is
      skipped rather than aborting the whole cache (GSAK's own free-text
      "Custom" trackable entries, if any, would not match and are silently
      dropped rather than imported as garbage).
      Like Waypoints/Attributes/Logs, Trackables are now unconditionally
      rebuilt (delete + recreate) on every import of a given cache — this is
      a deliberate change from the previous "leave Trackables completely
      untouched" behaviour (see git history), made consistent with the rest
      of the importer's one-time-migration philosophy (#472). One
      consequence worth knowing: re-importing a GSAK database now overwrites
      any Trackables a cache already had from an earlier *GPX* import with
      whatever GSAK currently has for that cache.

Deliberately NOT imported yet (later sessions per #469 plan):
    - Custom/CustomLocal, Ignore (out of scope / #473)
    - Cache.find_count (issue #517 prep column) — GSAK's own FoundCount
      turned out (verified against a real 12,600-cache database) to be
      identical to Found (0/1, "found by me"), not a true community find
      count, so there is no honest GSAK source for it yet. A count of
      "Found it" logs per cache (now available, see session 2 above) is
      the closest approximation — still deliberately not wired up to
      find_count, since it would not match the real GC.com number for
      caches with partial/capped log history, and it's better to make that
      a conscious choice with Allan than a silent approximation.

This is still a *partial*-scope import (Custom fields / Ignore list remain
out of scope, see #473) — but as of session 4, Waypoints, Attributes, Logs
and Trackables are all rebuilt (delete + recreate) on every re-import here,
same as the GPX importer's ``_upsert_cache``.

# Confirmed against GSAK's own documentation (gsak.net/help/hs10300.htm,

# E=event, L=locationless, V=virtual, W=webcam, O=Other, G=Benchmark,

# real distribution in both test databases (Sommerhus.zip: T/U/R only;
# GSAK_Database_Backup.zip: all 12 codes below, matching real-world type
# frequency — e.g. T=9984, U=1575, M=512, R=111 out of 12,600 caches).
#
# Issue #532: the 13 codes above don't cover GSAK's full $d_CacheType list
# (gsak.net/help/hs21040.htm), which also documents A/D/F/H/J/P/Q/X/Y/Z.
# Any code missing from this map falls through to the "Unknown Cache"
# default in _row_to_cache_data() — which silently turned every imported
# Adventure Lab cache (code Q) into a Mystery cache, reported independently
# by two users (Véé X Péé on Facebook, and visible in C3GPS's #530 GSAK
# import log: LB-prefixed Lab caches showing cache_type "Unknown Cache").
#
# Added below: six more codes with an unambiguous, already-existing
# OpenSAK CACHE_TYPES equivalent (utils/constants.py). Deliberately NOT
# added at the time: D ("Groundspeak Lost and Found Celebration") and F
# ("Lost and Found Event") — two distinct legacy event variants with no
# clear 1:1 match to our single "Community Celebration Event" entry —
# and Y (Waymark), which has no OpenSAK equivalent at all.
#
# Issue #756: F resolved. A real-world geocaching.com GPX export (88
# Community Celebration Event caches) confirms geocaching.com's own
# machine-readable type string for these is literally "Lost and Found
# Event Caches" — i.e. GSAK's code F. F now maps to "Community
# Celebration Event". D ("Groundspeak Lost and Found Celebration") is a
# separate, distinct legacy Groundspeak program and stays unmapped
# (falls back to "Unknown Cache") pending confirming evidence — as does
# Y (Waymark), which still has no OpenSAK equivalent at all.
