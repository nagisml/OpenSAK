"""
src/opensak/macro/runtime.py — Lua macro runtime (proof of concept).

Runs a user's Lua script in a sandboxed interpreter and exposes a small
`opensak` API table to it. The runtime is kept free of Qt: everything that
touches the main window goes through a MacroHost, so the runtime can be
unit-tested with a fake host.

The Lua API is defined once, in API and FILTER_KEY_DOCS below: run() builds
the `opensak` table from API, and docs/macros/api.md plus the Lua Language
Server stub macros/types/opensak.lua are generated from both
(python scripts/generate_macro_api_docs.py). test_macro_api_docs fails when
a function is exposed without documentation or a generated file is stale.

Known limitation (#938 step 4): the instruction limit only counts Lua VM
instructions, not work inside C functions. Lua pattern matching backtracks
in C, so e.g. string.rep("a", 100):find(".-.-.-.-.-b") runs ~12 s despite
instruction_limit=100_000, and longer subjects take minutes. The memory
limit does not help either (matching allocates nothing). Consequences:
  * The opensak.re functions therefore use the `regex` module with its
    timeout= argument, not Python's `re` (see helpers.py).
  * A worker thread keeps the GUI responsive and lets a Cancel button
    abandon the run, but cannot stop a call that is already running; only a
    subprocess can be terminated hard. This belongs to the threading decision.
