# ── Geocache attribute IDs (Groundspeak) ──────────────────────────────────────
# Each tuple: (attribute_id, translation_key)
#
# Issue #615: the previous version of this table had 42 of 70 IDs mapped to the
# wrong attribute (e.g. id 31 showed "Food nearby" instead of "Camping
# available"). This directly broke attribute names on GSAK-database import
# (gsak_importer.py resolves GSAK's numeric-only aId via this table) and — a
# separate, wider-impact discovery — the attribute filter in filter_dialog.py,
# which builds its checkbox rows and filter values from this same table for
# *every* import source (GPX and GSAK alike).
#
# Rebuilt and verified July 2026 by cross-referencing real GPX exports from
# geocaching.com (which embed the official id + English name directly in each
# <groundspeak:attribute id="X">Name</groundspeak:attribute> element) against
# opencaching.eu's community-maintained "GC reference" cross-reference table
# (https://opencaching.eu/index.php/Cache_attributes), used for exactly this
# kind of third-party GPX compatibility work.
#
# 63 of the 70 IDs below were confirmed directly against real GPX exports
# (single-cache downloads plus several purpose-built test caches covering
# 15-16 attributes each). The remaining 7 — marked UNVERIFIED — are mostly
# HQ/program-controlled attributes (needs-maintenance flag, Lost & Found Tour,
# Partnership, GeoTour) that can't be set via the normal attribute picker, or
# require cache types we didn't build test caches for (Bonus, Challenge,
# Solution checker). These 7 are taken from the opencaching.eu reference only.
#
# attr_first_aid (previously wrongly at id 38, which is actually Campfires)
# has been dropped entirely: there is no "First Aid nearby" attribute in the
# official Groundspeak list, in either source used here.

# and when syncing found status from a reference database (db/found_updater.py).
#
# "Found it"            — regular/multi/virtual/unknown/etc. caches
# "Attended"            — Event Cache, Mega-Event, CITO, ... (no "Found it" log)
# "Webcam Photo Taken"  — old-style Webcam Caches, before webcam logging was
#                          switched over to "Found it". Still present in many
#                          users' older My Finds history.

# webcam caches and events silently ended up with no found date on import.

# ── FTF (First to Find) tag pattern (issue #114 follow-up) ───────────────────
# ProjectGC (the de-facto FTF stats provider most geocachers use) only credits
# an FTF when the log contains one of these exact tags — see
# https://project-gc.com/w/First_to_Find and https://project-gc.com/Home/FAQ:
#   {FTF}   {*FTF*}   [FTF]
#
# The previous implementation matched free-text phrases ("ftf", "first to
# find", "first finder", "første til at finde") anywhere in the user's own
# found-log text. That produced false positives whenever a log merely
# mentioned the concept without claiming it, e.g. "...forgæves forsøg på at
# blive first finder..." (a log about NOT getting FTF) got flagged as FTF.
#
# FTF_TAG_PATTERN matches only the tags above, case-insensitively:
#   {FTF} / {ftf}, {*FTF*} / {*ftf*}, [FTF] / [ftf]
