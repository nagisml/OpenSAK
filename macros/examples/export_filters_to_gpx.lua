-- export_filters_to_gpx.lua — one GPX file per saved filter
--
-- Applies each filter in FILTERS in turn and exports the caches it shows
-- with the saved export setting EXPORT_SETTING, so every filter ends up in
-- a file of its own.
--
-- Setup, once:
--
--   1. File → Export → GPX/LOC/GGZ: choose GPX, a folder and a file name
--      containing {filter}, e.g. "{filter}_{date}", then save the options
--      as "GPX Export". Without {filter} every filter would write the same
--      file — the macro stops when that happens.
--   2. Settings → Folder permissions: give that folder write permission
--      (opensak.temp_dir() has it by default).
--   3. Put the names of three of your saved filters into FILTERS below.
--
-- A filter that is not saved, or that matches no cache, is skipped: with no
-- match the view is left unchanged, so exporting would write the caches of
-- the previous filter again. What happens to an existing file follows the
-- setting's "if the file exists" option. The last exported filter stays
-- active afterwards.
